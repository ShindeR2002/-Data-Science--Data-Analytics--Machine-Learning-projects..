# Neural Network from Scratch & MNIST Digit Classification

This project demonstrates a complete understanding of **neural networks**, starting from core theory and mathematical foundations to practical implementation and application on the **MNIST handwritten digit dataset**.

The goal is to build intuition for how neural networks work internally and then apply them to a real-world classification problem.
