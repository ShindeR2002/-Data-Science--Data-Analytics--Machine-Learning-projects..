1. Virtual Environments (venv)
The Concept: You learned that a venv is a local "toolbox" for your project. You don't need a new one for every folder if projects are similar, but it's best practice for isolation.

The Mistake: Initially, Git tried to track the venv folder, causing 920+ unwanted changes to appear.

The Fix: You created a .gitignore file in the root directory and added venv/ to it, which instantly cleaned up your Git status.

2. Environment & Folder Management
OneDrive Caution: We identified that working directly inside a OneDrive folder can cause "sync locks" and permission errors because OneDrive and Git both try to control the files at the same time.

Identity: You configured your global Git identity using:

git config --global user.name "Rohit Shinde"

git config --global user.email "rshinde2603@gmail.com"

3. Solving GitHub Connection Issues
The Error: You encountered a 403 Forbidden error, meaning GitHub recognized you but wouldn't let you "write" to the repository.

The Permission Popup: VS Code suggested "Creating a Fork" because it didn't realize you were the owner of the repo.

The Ultimate Fix: You bypassed all login popups by using a Personal Access Token (PAT). By running git remote set-url origin https://<TOKEN>@github.com/..., you "hardcoded" your permission, which finally allowed you to push your code
